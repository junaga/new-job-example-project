### [C# programming language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)

C# is a C-like, object oriented, "component oriented", strongly generically typed, garbage collected, asynchronous, event-driven, programming language.

C# is mostly compiled into assembly `.dll` modules, which run on .NET. There is a [query expression syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/) in C# to write SQL and others in-code.

> In addition to the runtime services, .NET also includes extensive libraries.

The typical C# application uses the .NET class library extensively to handle common "plumbing" chores.
